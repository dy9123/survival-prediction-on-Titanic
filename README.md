# survival-prediction-on-Titanic
This is a Kaggle competition. You can get more details from here https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic
In this project, we tested different machine learning algorithms to predict which passenger survived in this tragedy.
1. We first performed feature engineering based on some intuitive and reasonable assumption.
2. We then addressed the issue of missing value by using the Mice Package in R.
3. We then implement different algorithms, including KNN, random forest and Xgboost. 

We report the final accuracy of 82.7%, achieved by random forest.
