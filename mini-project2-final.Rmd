## 1. Load and check data
### 1.1 Load the library
```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(randomForest)
library(ggplot2)
library(lattice)
library(mice)
library(party)
library(MLmetrics)
```


### 1.2 Load the data
```{r}
setwd("C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Desktop\\mini-project2")
train = read_csv("train.csv")
test = read_csv("test.csv")
```


### 1.3 Fix some errors in this dataset
#### The following fixes SibSp/Parch values for two passengers (Id=280 and Id=1284). Because a 16 year old can¡¯t have a 13 year old son! He goes further and confirm it with historical data.
```{r}
train$SibSp[train$PassengerId==280] = 0
train$Parch[train$PassengerId==280] = 2
test$SibSp[test$PassengerId==1284] = 1
test$Parch[test$PassengerId==1284] = 1
```


### 1.4 Combine data
```{r}
test$Survived = rep(NA, dim(test)[1])
total = bind_rows(train, test)
```


### 1.5 Transform Survived to a categorical target for binary classification
```{r}
total$Survived = as.factor(total$Survived)
total$Sex = as.factor(total$Sex)
total$Pclass = as.ordered(total$Pclass)
total$Embarked = as.ordered(total$Embarked)
```


## 2. Exploring some important variables
### 2.1 Pclass
```{r}
ggplot(total[!is.na(total$Survived),], aes(x = Pclass, fill = Survived)) +
geom_bar(stat='count', position='dodge') +
labs(x = 'Pclass') + theme_bw() +
scale_x_discrete (limits = c('1', '2', '3')) +
geom_text(stat = "count", aes(label = ..count..), position=position_dodge(width=1), vjust=-0.5)
```

#### most of passengers of Pclass=1 survived£¬half of the passenger of Pclass=2 survived£¬only 25% of passengers of Pclass=3 survived


### 2.2 Surname
#### Variable "Name" contains information about identity. People with the same surname may belong to the same family, which may all die or all survive. Given that the surname which appears only once cannot exist in training set and test set simultaneously, they are useless in predicting survival. So we name them "small"
```{r}
total$FamilySize = total$SibSp + total$Parch + 1

total$Surname = sapply(total$Name, FUN=function(x) {strsplit(x, split='[,.]')[[1]][1]})
total$FamilyID = paste(as.character(total$FamilySize), total$Surname, sep="")
total$FamilyID[total$FamilySize <= 2] = 'Small'
famIDs = data.frame(table(total$FamilyID))
famIDs = famIDs[famIDs$Freq <= 2,]
total$FamilyID[total$FamilyID %in% famIDs$Var1] = 'Small'
total$FamilyID = factor(total$FamilyID)
```


### 2.3 Title
#### The name variable contains some information about title and family(e.g. Surname), so we create some significative variables.
```{r}
total$title =  gsub("^.*, (.*?)\\..*$", "\\1", total$Name)
table(total$title)
```
#### The table shows that there are too many titles to analyze, so we try to reduce the number of titles.
```{r}
total$title[total$title == 'Capt']  = 'Officer'
total$title[total$title == 'Col']   = 'Officer'
total$title[total$title == 'Don']   = 'Officer'
total$title[total$title == 'Dr']    = 'Officer'
total$title[total$title == 'Major']    = 'Officer'
total$title[total$title == 'Rev']    = 'Officer'

total$title[total$title == 'Lady']  = 'Miss'
total$title[total$title == 'Mlle']  = 'Miss'
total$title[total$title == 'Mme']   = 'Miss'
total$title[total$title == 'Ms']    = 'Miss'

total$title[total$title == 'Jonkheer']    = 'Mr'
total$title[total$title == 'Sir']    = 'Mr'

total$title[total$title == 'Dona']  = 'Mrs'
total$title[total$title == 'the Countess'] = 'Mrs'

total$title = as.factor(total$title)

table(total$Sex, total$title)
```
```{r}
ggplot(total[!is.na(total$Survived),], aes(x = title, fill = Survived)) +
geom_bar(stat='count', position='dodge') +
labs(x = 'Title') + theme_bw() +
scale_x_discrete (limits = c('Master', 'Miss', 'Mr', 'Mrs', 'Officer')) +
geom_text(stat = "count", aes(label = ..count..), position=position_dodge(width=1), vjust=-0.5)
```


### 2.4 Sex
```{r}
ggplot(total[!is.na(total$Survived),], aes(x = Sex, fill = Survived)) +
geom_bar(stat='count', position='dodge') + theme_bw() +
labs(x = 'Training data only') +
geom_text(stat = "count", aes(label = ..count..), position=position_dodge(width=1), vjust=-0.5)
```

```{r}
468/(468+81)
```
#### The 85.25% of dead people are male within the training data.


### 2.5 Age
```{r}
ggplot(total[!is.na(total$Survived),], aes(x = Age, color=Survived)) + 
  geom_line(aes(label = ..count..), stat = 'bin', binwidth=5)  + theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "How Age impact survivor", x = "Age", y = "Count", fill = "Survived")
```

#### Young adults have high probability of survival while the young children and the elderly has roughly the same probability of survival.


### 2.6 Family Size
#### The variables sibsp and parch represent the family size, we can create a new variable to combine these relation.
```{r}
total$FamilySize = total$SibSp + total$Parch + 1 

total$FamilySized[total$FamilySize == 1] = 'solo'
total$FamilySized[total$FamilySize == 2] = 'duble'
total$FamilySized[total$FamilySize >=3 & total$FamilySize <=4] = 'group'
total$FamilySized[total$FamilySize >= 5] = 'large group'
total$FamilySized = as.factor(total$FamilySized)

ggplot(total[!is.na(total$Survived),], aes(x = FamilySize, fill = Survived)) +
geom_bar(stat='count', position='dodge') +
scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(1:11)) +
labs(x = 'Family Size') + theme_bw()+
geom_text(stat = "count", aes(label = ..count..), position=position_dodge(width=1), vjust=-0.5)
```
```{r}
ggplot(total[!is.na(total$Survived),], aes(x = FamilySized, fill = Survived)) +
geom_bar(stat='count', position='dodge') +
labs(x = 'Final Group Categories') + theme_bw() +
scale_x_discrete (limits = c('solo', 'duble', 'group', 'large group')) + 
geom_text(stat = "count", aes(label = ..count..), position=position_dodge(width=1), vjust=-0.5)
```


### 2.7 Ticket
#### Passengers with the same ticket number are families. They may all survive or die. We divided the passengers into two groups, the first group consists of people with unique ticket number. The second group consists of people with shared ticket number. We calculate the number of survival in each group.
```{r}
ticket.count = aggregate(total$Ticket, by = list(total$Ticket), function(x) sum(!is.na(x)))
total$TicketCount = apply(total, 1, function(x) ticket.count[which(ticket.count[, 1] == x['Ticket']), 2])
total$TicketCount = factor(sapply(total$TicketCount, function(x) ifelse(x > 1, 'Share', 'Unique')))
ggplot(total[!is.na(total$Survived),], mapping = aes(x = TicketCount, y = ..count.., fill=Survived)) + 
geom_bar(stat = 'count', position='dodge') + 
xlab('TicketCount') + 
ylab('Count') + theme_bw() +
ggtitle('How TicketCount impact survivor') + 
geom_text(stat = "count", aes(label = ..count..), position=position_dodge(width=1), , vjust=-0.5) + 
theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position="bottom")
```


### 2.8 Embarked
#### The city of Embarked may be another significant factors, due to the difference of the level of economy.
```{r}
ggplot(total[!is.na(total$Survived),], mapping = aes(x = Embarked, y = ..count.., fill = Survived)) +
geom_bar(stat = 'count', position='dodge') + 
xlab('Embarked') +
ylab('Count') + theme_bw() +
ggtitle('How Embarked impact survivor') +
geom_text(stat = "count", aes(label = ..count..), position=position_dodge(width=1), , vjust=-0.5) + 
theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position="bottom")
```
#### Obviously, passengers from "C" and "Q" were more likely to survive.


## 3. Missing data
### 3.1 Fare values: 1 passengers(PassengerId=1044)
```{r}
total[1044,]
```
#### This passenger embarked from 'S', and his Pclass was 3. We reasonably use the value of median for this Pclass and embarkment to replace the NA Fare.
```{r}
total$Fare[1044] = median(total[total$Pclass == '3' & total$Embarked == 'S', ]$Fare, na.rm = TRUE)
```


### 3.2 Embarked values: 2 passengers(PassengerId=62, 830)
#### Embarked could be important to Fare, as different Embarkement cities mean longer or shorter journeys.
```{r}
rbind(total[62,],total[830,])
```
#### We use the most common code to replace NAs in the Embarked feature.
```{r}
total$Embarked[c(62, 830)] = 'S'
```


### 3.3 Cabin values: 77% missing
#### We don't use this variable to predict.


### 3.4 Age values: 20% missing
#### We choose mice package to predict the missing data.
```{r}
set.seed(319)
mice.Age = mice(total[, names(total) %in% c('Pclass','Sex','Age','Fare','Embarked','FamilySize', 'FamilySized',  'title', 'FamilyID', 'TicketCount')], method='rf')
```
```{r}
mice.output = complete(mice.Age)
```
#### Let¡¯s compare the results we get with the original distribution of passenger ages to ensure that nothing has gone completely awry.
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(total$Age, freq=F, main='Age: Original Data', 
  col='skyblue', ylim=c(0,0.04))
hist(mice.output$Age, freq=F, main='Age: MICE Output', 
  col='blue', ylim=c(0,0.04))
```

#### It seems reasonable, thus we use the mice model to predict the missing value of Age.
```{r}
total$Age = mice.output$Age
```


## 4. Prediction
# Random Forest model
```{r}
set.seed(10)
model = cforest(as.factor(Survived) ~ Pclass + Sex + Age + Fare + Embarked + FamilySize + title + FamilyID + TicketCount, data = total[1:891, ], controls=cforest_unbiased(ntree=1000, mtry=3))

cv.summarize <- function(data.true, data.predict) {
  print(paste('Recall:', Recall(data.true, data.predict)))
  print(paste('Precision:', Precision(data.true, data.predict)))
  print(paste('Accuracy:', Accuracy(data.predict, data.true)))
  print(paste('AUC:', AUC(data.predict, data.true)))
 }
set.seed(10)
cv.test.sample = sample(1:nrow(train), as.integer(0.3 * nrow(train)), replace = TRUE)
cv.test = total[cv.test.sample,]
cv.prediction = predict(model, cv.test, OOB=TRUE, type = "response")
cv.summarize(cv.test$Survived, cv.prediction)
```


## 5. Conclusion
```{r}
predict.result = predict(model, total[(1+nrow(train)):(nrow(total)), ], OOB=TRUE, type = "response")
output = data.frame(PassengerId = test$PassengerId, Survived = predict.result)
write.csv(output, file = "final.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
